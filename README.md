# Coresets-for-Clustering-with-Missing-Values
This repository contains a Python implementation of the algorithms presented in the “Coresets for Clustering with Missing Values” paper. The project is developed as part of the CS5234 - Advanced Algorithms coursework at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

## Features
- Implements the coresets construction for clustering problems with missing data.
- Includes algorithms for k-means clustering.
- Handles missing values efficiently using the techniques described in the paper.
- Provides plot codes for an illustrative example.
